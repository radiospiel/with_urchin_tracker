This is a simple test infrastructure for plugins. Here is how to use it
(note: all path s are relative to the test subdir):

1)

Check config/database.yml for the database configuration. 

The default configuration runs against an in-memory sqlite3 database 
(and needs the sqlite3 gem). To run against a different database, you
would use

  rake DB=postgresql
  
2)

Use config/models.rb to define database structures and ActiveRecord 
classes needed by your tests. Use config/controllers.rb to define
controllers needed by your tests.

3)

fixtures go into ./fixtures, views go into ./views

4)

tests are below ./tests. They should 
  
  "require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../config/test.rb'"

on top.

5)

Start testing! Note, that all tests take place in the context of the
application, where the plugin is installed into.
